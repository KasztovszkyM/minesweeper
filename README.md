# minesweeper
My 3rd semester university project written in Java using Swing for user interface and JUnit for unit testing. Implements Minesweeper game with additional elements such as timed bombs and persistent (saved to file) leaderboard. It focuses more on object oriented design than my previous projects and provided good pracitce in Java. 

Detailed (hungarian) documantation can be found in the pdf files in the project hierarchy.
